Description:
    This script automates the processing of all EPUB and PDF files in a specified directory ('novels_file') by
    calling the text_extractor script for each file. It determines the language of each file based on the
    presence of '_en' or '_tr' in the filenames and passes this information along with the file path to
    'text_extractor.py'. This allows for batch processing of files for text extraction and sentence tokenization.

Usage:
    python process_novels.py

Notes:
    Ensure that text_extractor.py is in the same directory as this script or adjust the 'script_name' variable
    to point to the correct location of text_extractor.py. The directory to be processed is hardcoded as
    'novels_file'; modify this variable if a different directory name is used.
