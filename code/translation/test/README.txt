We evaluated the fine-tuned models by using the best model and by testing the performance on all 3 checkpoints. Our goal is to further investigate the differences between BLEU and chr-F scores and how they contribute to translation output. We have a hunch that the differences in translation practices with regards to person and placenames could be causing lower BLEU scores, when even if the model translation is not wrong. 
For example, Ottoman Temeşvar in modern-day Romania can be translated as Timișoara using its current name or as Temesvár using its historical Hungarian name or just retained as Temeşvar. We should account for these complexities when evaluating historical translation.
