The 13 novels listed below were selected based on a combination of factors: personal domain knowledge, support of Eyüp Eren Yürek, friend of the author and a scholar in Comparative Literature, and \href{https://sites.bu.edu/artichoke/resources/bibliography-of-work-available-for-purchase/}{this bibliography}. We believe that data acquisition is an iterative process and intend to increase the number of novels in our pipeline reflecting on the results of the model training.

Since most of these novels and almost all the translations are under copyright, we cannot not publish the dataset in its entirety. Instead, we published a small (10 percent of the dataset) random sample of sentences as permitted by fair use laws for publication.
